# Hi 👋, I'm Kenward Terhemba

## A Software Engineer

With over five years of experience in veterinary medicine, I’ve transitioned into backend engineering—bringing a unique, problem-solving perspective shaped by science and care. I specialize in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), and also work with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). I’m proficient with Git and GitHub, and currently expanding my skills in Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps.

Outside of tech, I’m passionate about traveling and volunteering—especially supporting children with disabilities.
